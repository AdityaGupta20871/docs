## Overdue

Your organization reaches an overdue state when you exceed the usage of some of its resources.
You can choose any one of the following to satisfy the constraint limits to get out of the overdue state:

1. Buy a subscription to increase your resources.
2. Buy a bonus for a specific resource that is exceeding.
3. Remove specific resources manually.
