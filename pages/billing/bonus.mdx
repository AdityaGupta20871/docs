  **Troubleshoot:**
  - ***For All Networks except Solana:*** If your transaction fails,
  check if the Spheron escrow wallet has enough balance. To deposit more funds,
  go through the Deposit Funds section.
  - ***For Solana:*** If your transaction fails
  and the amounts get deducted, you can click 'Already Paid?' in the transaction
  section. You can then enter the transaction hash, and if it is verified, your
  transaction will succeed.
