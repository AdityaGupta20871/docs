1. Upgrade Plan:
   - Click Upgrade Plan under the Billing tab.
   - Click Switch to Pro.
2. Configure Wallet:

   - Choose Avalanche, your desired token, and wallet, and Click Save.
   - Sign the transaction in your selected wallet to connect your wallet.
3. Plan Details:
   - If you have a coupon code, you can add it in the Coupon code section and Click on the arrow button to activate it.
   - Read the transaction details and Click Deposit. If you have already deposited the funds, you can move to step 5.
4. Deposit Funds:
   - To make sure your subscription is renewed every month, you need to deposit funds to the Spheron escrow wallet.
   - Add the amount you want to approve and Click Approve. This amount should be more than or equal to the plan's Token-Value (total amount).
   - Add the amount you want to deposit and Click Deposit. Make sure it is not more than the approved amount, or else the transaction will fail.
5. Click Upgrade Plan to initiate the transaction. Upon successful transaction, the plan will be upgraded to pro.

  **Troubleshoot:** \ If your transaction fails, check if the Spheron escrow
  wallet has enough balance for the transaction. To deposit more funds, Select
  Deposit Funds from the connect wallet dropdown.
