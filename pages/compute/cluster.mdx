# Cluster

## Deploy from Docker Hub

Spheron allows you to create a new cluster with a custom docker image.
To create a cluster:

1. Click **New Cluster** on the top right corner.
2. Select **Import from Docker Hub**.
3. Enter the names for your cluster and docker image.
4. Then, Add the tag and Click **Next**.
5. Select the instance plan that suits your needs and Click **Select Plan**.
6. Click **Deploy** to initiate deployment without additional configuration.

<Callout>
  **Troubleshoot:** You can change your plan by clicking Change Plan above the
  selected plan.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** \
  1\. Before running the **docker build** command, run this command in your terminal:\
  `export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64`. \
  2\. Spheron supports only public docker images at the moment. \
  3\. Learn how to dockerize your server and push the docker image to the docker hub [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/02_our_app/).

### Additional Configuration

#### Port Mapping

Port Mapping is used to direct incoming traffic from the outside world to a specific container port, which is then exposed as an external port.
For example, suppose you have a container running a web server that is listening on port 8080, but you want to expose it to the public internet on port 80.
By mapping port 80 to the container port 8080, incoming traffic on port 80 is automatically directed to the web server running inside the container on port 8080.
This way, users can access the web server by using its public IP address and the exposed port number.

Port Mapping is required for deployment. To create a new port mapping:

1. Click **New Port Mapping** under `Additional Configuration`.
2. Add the container port, and Select the exposed port you want to map it to.

#### Environment Variables

Spheron allows you to add environment variables while configuring your deployment.
They contain information such as directory paths, or credentials.
To configure these variables:

1. Click **New Variable** under `Additional Configuration` to add new environment variable.
2. Add key and value. Use the **Secret Key** toggle if the value is a secret key.

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** When you enable the secret key toggle, it will not be saved in the database.
</Callout>

#### Region

Region refers to specific geographic locations where where a cloud service provider (CSP) has its data centers and computing resources.
By choosing a region closer to your users, you can improve performance and reduce latency.
Spheron offers the following regions for you to choose from:

- us-east
- us-west
- us-central
- eu-west
- any

To choose a region, navigate to the `Region` section under **Additional Configuration** and select your preferred region.

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** Selecting `any` as the region will deploy the container in any region.
</Callout>

#### Advanced Configuration

Advanced Configurations gives you more flexibility and control over how your Docker container is launched and can help you customize its behavior to meet the specific needs of your application.
**Commands** and **Arguments** fields in the advanced configuration allows you to specify any additional commands or arguments that should be passed to the Docker container when it is launched. \
To add Commands and Arguments:

1. Click **Advanced Configuration** under `Additional Configuration` if you want add advanced configuration.
2. Click **New Command** to add a new command.
3. Click **New Argument** to add a new argument.

#### Health Checkup

Health Checkup is critical to monitor the reliability and performance of your instance.
It helps minimize downtime and provides a better user experience.
To configure Health Checkup:

1. Click **Health Checkup** under `Additional Configuration`.
2. Add the desired health check path and health check port.

## Deploy from Marketplace App

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with various applications, all set up and ready to use on the Akash Network.
To deploy a marketplace app:

1. Click **New Cluster** on the top right corner.
2. Select **Select marketplace app**.
3. Pick your desired template from the marketplace.
4. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template.
5. If you want to change the plan, Click **Change Plan**.
6. Select the instance plan that suits your needs, and Click **Select Plan**.
7. Click **Deploy** to initiate deployment without additional configuration.

### Additional Configuration

#### Region

This section is the same as the [region section](/compute/cluster/#region) mentioned above.

#### App Configuration

App Configuration is applicable to certain apps only, and not to all.
For these specific apps, it is essential to fill in all the necessary configurations.
That includes adding the **root username** and **root password** under their respective sections.

## Verify Installation

The Marketplace App can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using the app.
Most Marketplace Apps can be verified for successful installation using the instructions below, while others may require different procedures.

- **Attempt to access the app** \
  A Marketplace App has an estimated deployment time of about 1-2 minutes.
  If you can successfully access it, the installation has been completed successfully.
  You can connect to the app with a `reverse DNS link` provided if the app has an HTTP port.
  If not, you can connect using the connection URL of the instance, which will also be provided after the instance is provisioned.
- **Check instance logs and events** \
  After successfully deploying a Marketplace App, it will produce logs and events, which you can check for any issues or errors.
