# How to Deploy Docusarus Apps on Spheron

This guide will show you how to deploy a Docusarus project and get your domain up.
[Docusarus](https://docusaurus.io/) is a tool designed to make it easy for teams to publish documentation websites without worrying about the infrastructure and design details. At its core, all a user has to provide documentation files written in Markdown, customization of a provided home page written in React, and a few configuration modifications.

## Deploy Docusarus to Spheron

Follow these steps to deploy your Docusarus app on Spheron.

### Step 1: Put Your Docusarus Project Code in a Git Repo

While this feature is not new to developers, the magic of Spheron is that every push to any branch in your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repo triggers a new build and deployment of your project.

### Step 2: Deploy using the Spheron Platform UI.

You can create a new Spheron project using the platform UI. First, visit [Spheron Network](https://app.spheron.network/) in your browser.
Choose your preferred Git provider from the options as seen above and authorize Spheron to access the repo you want to deploy.
In the next screen, select your Docusarus repo from the list.
Choose your preferred protocol where you want to deploy your static build. As of now, we support Arweave, Skynet, Filecoin & Pinata. You can choose any one protocol from all 4 of them.
The third screen asks for details about where to create the project and how to build it. All the settings are already pre-filled based on the suggested framework. Learn more about each build setting. Check it out [here](https://docs.spheron.network/deployments/get-started#configuring-the-deployment).

1. Choose the branch to deploy from the dropdown and provide the root directory if you have a mono repo-like app structure.
2. Set the **install command** to yarn install
3. Set the **build command** to yarn build
4. Set the **publish directory** to build
5. You can add some environment variables before the build.
6. You can change the node engine of your deployment as well.
7. Click "Deploy"

## That's All!

Now that you've deployed your Docusarus project on Spheron, you have all the benefits of Spheron — including a custom deployment environment, continuous deployment whenever you push to your repo, and much more — as well as the benefits of Docusarus like Preview Mode, Static site rendering.
After deploying, your new Docusarus project will automatically be assigned a `.spheron.app` suffixed domain. You can then add a [Custom Domain](https://docs.spheron.network/domain-and-https/centralized-domain/attach-domain) of your choice.
We're so excited to see what you build with Docusarus on Spheron!
