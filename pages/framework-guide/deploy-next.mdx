# How to Deploy a Next.js Site with Spheron

<Callout type="warning">
  If your Next.js app contains APIs, deploy your app on Spheron Compute by
  following [this guide.](/server-guide/nextjs/)
</Callout>

This guide will show you how to deploy a Next.js project and get your domain up.
[Next.js](https://vercel.com/solutions/nextjs) is the React framework created by Vercel. Next.js is an open-source web development framework built on Node.js, enabling React-based web applications functionalities such as server-side rendering and generating static websites.

## Deploy Next.js to Spheron

Follow these steps to deploy your first Next.js app on Spheron successfully.

### Step 1: Put Your Next.js Project Code in a Git Repo

While this feature is not new to developers, the magic of Spheron is that every push to any branch in your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repo triggers a new build and deployment of your project.

### Step 2: Update Your Next.js Project for Deploying on Decentralised Storage

Now, deploying your Next.js app without doing any manual process is possible. But to ensure the decentralized storage deployment works completely fine, we need to update specific configurations on the Next.js. Here are all the changes you need to make to make the deployment work:
Add this configuration in your next.config.js file:

```js
module.exports = {
  ...,
  images: {
    loader: 'akamai',
    path: '',
  },
  trailingSlash: true,
}
```

If you are getting this error while deploying your app using Spheron → Error: Image Optimization using Next.js' default loader is incompatible with 'next export.' The fix for this issue is images:

```js
{
  "loader": "akamai",
  "path": ""
}
```

The trailingSlash: true will fix the routing refresh issue in IPFS or Skynet.
Also, if you see images not found in your other routes, you need to update the `next.config.js` file with this configuration:

```js
const isProd = process.env.NODE_ENV === "production";

module.exports = {
  ...,
  assetPrefix: isProd ? "https://your-domain.com" : "",
}
```

### Step 3: Deploy using the Spheron Platform UI.

You can create a new Spheron project using the platform UI. First, visit [Spheron Protocol](https://app.spheron.network/) in your browser.
Choose your preferred Git provider from the options and authorize Spheron to access the repo you want to deploy.
In the next screen, select your Next.js repo from the list.
Choose your preferred protocol where you want to deploy your static build. As of now, we support Arweave, Skynet, Filecoin & Pinata. You can choose any one protocol from all 4 of them.
The third screen asks for details about where to create the project and how to build it. All the settings are already pre-filled based on the suggested framework. Learn more about each build setting. Check out [here](https://docs.spheron.network/deployments/get-started#configuring-the-deployment).

1. Choose the branch to deploy from the dropdown and provide the root directory if you have a monorepo-like app structure.
2. Set the install command to yarn install
3. Set the build command to next build && next export
4. Set the publish directory to out
5. You can add some environment variables before the build.
6. You can change the node engine of your deployment as well.
7. Click Deploy

## That's All!

Now that you've deployed your Next.js project on Spheron, you have all the benefits of Spheron — including a custom deployment environment, continuous deployment whenever you push to your repo, and much more — as well as the benefits of Next.js like Preview Mode, Static site rendering.
After deploying, your new Next.js project will automatically be assigned a `.spheron.app` suffixed domain. You can then add a [Custom Domain](https://docs.spheron.network/domain-and-https/centralized-domain/attach-domain) on your choice.
We're so excited to see what you build with Next.js on Spheron!
