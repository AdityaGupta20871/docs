# How to deploy Drupal?

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with Drupal, all set up and ready to use on the Akash Network.
To deploy Drupal:

1. Click **New Cluster** on the top right corner.
2. Select **Select marketplace app**.
3. Pick **Drupal** from the marketplace.
4. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template.
5. If you want to change the plan, Click **Change Plan**.
6. Select the instance plan that suits your needs, and Click **Select Plan**.
7. Select your preferred **Region** if any. If you do not add a region, the container will be deployed in any region. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#region) to know more.
8. Click **Deploy** to initiate deployment.

## Advanced Configuration

### Region

Refer the [region section](/compute/cluster/#region) for more information.

## Verify Installation

Drupal can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.

### How to connect to Drupal?

- Use the `Connection URL` provided by Spheron under **Port Policy Info for Port 80** to access the Drupal dashboard.

For more information, refer to the [Drupal docs](https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide/en/index.html).
