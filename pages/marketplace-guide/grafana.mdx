# How to deploy a Grafana dashboard?

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with Grafana, all set up and ready to use on the Akash Network.
To deploy a Grafana dashboard:

1. Click **New Cluster** on the top right corner.
2. Select **Select marketplace app**.
3. Pick **Grafana** from the marketplace.
4. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template.
5. If you want to change the plan, Click **Change Plan**.
6. Select the instance plan that suits your needs, and Click **Select Plan**.
7. Select your preferred **Region** if any. If you do not add a region, the container will be deployed in any region. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#region) to know more.
8. Click **Deploy** to initiate deployment.

## Advanced Configuration

### Region

Refer the [region section](/compute/cluster/#region) for more information.

## Verify Installation

The Grafana dashboard can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.

### How to connect to Grafana?

- Use the `Connection URL` provided by Spheron under **Port Policy Info** to access the Grafana dashboard.
- On the sign-in page, use `admin` as both the username and password. Once signed in, remember to change your password to complete the setup process.

For more information, refer to the [Grafana docs](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/getting-started/build-first-dashboard/).
