# How to deploy an IPFS Node?

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with IPFS, all set up and ready to use on the Akash Network.
To deploy an IPFS node:

1. Click **New Cluster** on the top right corner.
2. Select **Select marketplace app**.
3. Pick **IPFS** from the marketplace.
4. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template.
5. If you want to change the plan, Click **Change Plan**.
6. Select the instance plan that suits your needs, and Click **Select Plan**.
7. Select your preferred **Region** if any. If you do not add a region, the container will be deployed in any region. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#region) to know more.
8. Click **Deploy** to initiate deployment.

## Advanced Configuration

### Region

Refer the [region section](/compute/cluster/#region) for more information.

## Verify Installation

The IPFS Node can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.

### Upload files to IPFS using IPFS WebUI

Use the `Connection URL` provided by Spheron under **Port Policy Info for Port 5001** and append `/webui` to access the IPFS Web interface.

### Access files using IPFS Gateway

Use the `Connection URL` provided by Spheron under **Port Policy Info for Port 8080** and append `/ipfs/{cid}` to access your file directly from the IPFS network.

For more information, refer to the [IPFS docs](https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/desktop-app/#install-ipfs-desktop).
