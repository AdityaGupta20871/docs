# How to deploy a Kyve Node?

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with Kyve, all set up and ready to use on the Akash Network.
To deploy a Kyve node:

1. Click "New Cluster" on the top right corner.
2. Select **Select marketplace app**.
3. Pick **Kyve** from the marketplace.
4. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template.
5. If you want to change the plan, Click "Change Plan".
6. Select the instance plan that suits your needs, and Click "Select Plan".
7. Select your preferred **Region**, if any. If you do not add a region, the container will be deployed in any region. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#region) to know more.
8. Add **Pool**, **Mnemonic**, **Arweave Wallet Link** and **Network** for the Kyve instance. The default value for **Network** is already provided.
9. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

## Advanced Configuration

### Region

Refer to the [region section](/compute/cluster/#region) for more information.

### App Configuration

- **Pool** - The ID of the storage pool.
- **Mnemonic** - The mnemonic for the wallet of Kyve network.
- **Arweave Wallet Link** - The link to your Arweave Wallet mnemonic. You have to upload your Arweave wallet mnemonic and paste the link here.
- **Network** - The network to be used for the Kyve instance.

## Verify Installation

The Kyve Node can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.

For more information, refer to the [Kyve docs](https://docs.kyve.network/).
