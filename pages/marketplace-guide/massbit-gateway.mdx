6. Select the instance plan that suits your needs, and Click **Select Plan**.
7. Select your preferred **Region** if any. If you do not add a region, the container will be deployed in any region. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#region) to know more.
8. Add **Token** and **GW ID** for the MassBit Gateway instance, if any.
9. Click **Deploy** to initiate deployment.

## Advanced Configuration

### Region

Refer the [region section](/compute/cluster/#region) for more information.

### App Configuration

- **Token** - The token for the MassBit Gateway instance.
- **GW ID** - The Gateway ID for the MassBit Gateway instance.

## Verify Installation

The MassBit Route Gateway Node can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.

For more information, refer to the [Massbit docs](https://docs.massbit.io/about/massbit-intro).
