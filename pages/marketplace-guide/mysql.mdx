# How to deploy MySQL?

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with MySQL, all set up and ready to use on the Akash Network.
To deploy MySQL:

1. Click "New Cluster" on the top right corner.
2. Select **Select marketplace app**.
3. Pick **MySQL** from the marketplace.
4. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template.
5. If you want to change the plan, Click "Change Plan".
6. Select the instance plan that suits your needs, and Click "Select Plan".
7. Select your preferred **Region**, if any. If you do not add a region, the container will be deployed in any region. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#region) to know more.
8. Add the **Password** for the MySQL instance.
9. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

## Advanced Configuration

### Region

Refer to the [region section](/compute/cluster/#region) for more information.

### App Configuration

- **Password** - The password associated with the MySQL database.

## Verify Installation

MySQL can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.

```sh
$ mysql -h [host] -P [port] -u root -p
