# How to deploy PostgreSQL?

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with PostgreSQL, all set up and ready to use on the Akash Network.
To deploy PostgreSQL:

1. Click **New Cluster** on the top right corner.
2. Select **Select marketplace app**.
3. Pick **Postgres** from the marketplace.
4. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template.
5. If you want to change the plan, Click **Change Plan**.
6. Select the instance plan that suits your needs, and Click **Select Plan**.
7. Select your preferred **Region** if any. If you do not add a region, the container will be deployed in any region. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#region) to know more.
8. Add the **User**, **Password** and **Database** for the PostgreSQL instance, if any. The default values are already filled in the input fields.
9. Click **Deploy** to initiate deployment.

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** The default values for **User**, **Password** and **Database** is
  `admin`, `password` and `mydb` respectively.
</Callout>

## Advanced Configuration

### Region

Refer the [region section](/compute/cluster/#region) for more information.

### App Configuration

- **User** - The user for accessing the PostgreSQL database.
- **Password** - The password associated with the PostgreSQL database.
- **Database** - The name for the PostgreSQL database.

## Verify Installation

PostgreSQL can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.

### How to connect to PostgreSQL?

You can use the connection string URI to connect to PostgreSQL.
The standard URI connection scheme has the following format:

```
postgresql://[username:password@]host[:port][/dbname]
```

- `postgresql://` - A required prefix to identify that this is a string in the standard connection format.
- `username:password` - Authentication credentials passed in App Configuration.
- `host[:port]` - The host and port number where the postgresql instance is running. Use the `Connection URL` provided by Spheron under **Port Policy Info**.
- `/dbname` - The name of the database passed in App Configuration.

Run the following command in your terminal to test your connection:

```sh
psql postgresql://[username:password@]host[:port][/dbname]
```

For more information, refer to the [PostgreSQL docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html).
