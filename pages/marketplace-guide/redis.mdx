# How to deploy Redis?

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with Redis, all set up and ready to use on the Akash Network.
To deploy Redis:

1. Click "New Cluster" on the top right corner.
2. Select **Select marketplace app**.
3. Pick **Redis** from the marketplace.
4. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template.
5. If you want to change the plan, Click "Change Plan".
6. Select the instance plan that suits your needs, and Click "Select Plan".
7. Select your preferred **Region**, if any. If you do not add a region, the container will be deployed in any region. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#region) to know more.
8. Add the **Password** for the Redis instance.
9. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

## Advanced Configuration

### Region

Refer to the [region section](/compute/cluster/#region) for more information.

### App Configuration

- **Password** - The password associated with the Redis database.

## Verify Installation

Redis can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.

### How to connect to Redis?

You can use the connection string URI to connect to Redis.
The standard URI connection scheme has the following format:

```
redis://[password@]host[:port]
```

- `redis://` - A required prefix to identify that this is a string in the standard connection format.
- `password` - Authentication credentials passed in App Configuration.
- `host[:port]` - The host and port number where the redis instance is running. Use the `Connection URL` provided by Spheron under **Port Policy Info**.

Run the following command in your terminal to test your connection:

```sh
$ redis-cli -u redis://[password@]host[:port] PING
PONG
```

For more information, refer to the [Redis docs](https://redis.io/docs/ui/cli/).
