# How to deploy a Reef Node?

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with Reef, all set up and ready to use on the Akash Network.
To deploy a Reef node:

1. Click **New Cluster** on the top right corner.
2. Select **Select marketplace app**.
3. Pick **Reef** from the marketplace.
4. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template.
5. If you want to change the plan, Click **Change Plan**.
6. Select the instance plan that suits your needs, and Click **Select Plan**.
7. Select your preferred **Region** if any. If you do not add a region, the container will be deployed in any region. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#region) to know more.
8. Add **Network** and **Archive Node** for the Reef instance. The default values are already provided.
9. Click **Deploy** to initiate deployment.

## Advanced Configuration

### Region

Refer the [region section](/compute/cluster/#region) for more information.

### App Configuration

- **Network** - The network to be used for the Reef instance.
- **Archive Node** - `Yes` if you want to archive your node, otherwise `No`.

## Verify Installation

The Reef Node can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.

For more information, refer to the [Reef docs](https://docs.reef.io/docs/developers/nodes/).
