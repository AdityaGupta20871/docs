# How to deploy a Stride Node?

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with Stride, all set up and ready to use on the Akash Network.
To deploy a Stride node:

1. Click "New Cluster" on the top right corner.
2. Select **Select marketplace app**.
3. Pick **Stride** from the marketplace.
4. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template.
5. If you want to change the plan, Click "Change Plan".
6. Select the instance plan that suits your needs, and Click "Select Plan".
7. Select your preferred **Region**, if any. If you do not add a region, the container will be deployed in any region. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#region) to know more.
8. Add **Root Password**, **Moniker**, **Link Key**, **Github Repository**, **Snap RPC** and **Token** for the Stride instance. The default values for **Root Password**, **Github Repository** and **Snap RPC** are already provided.
9. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

## Advanced Configuration

### Region

Refer to the [region section](/compute/cluster/#region) for more information.

### App Configuration

- **Root Password** - The password associated with Stride.
- **Moniker** - The user-defined identifier assigned to a validator or staking entity on a blockchain network. It helps distinguish and recognize the specific validator node within the network.
- **Link Key** - The cryptographic key used to establish a secure connection between different components or entities within the staking infrastructure.
- **Github Repository** - The link to Stride's Github Repository.
- **Snap RPC** - The Snap RPC details for the Stride instance.
- **Token** - The token for the Stride instance.

## Verify Installation

The Stride Node can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.

For more information, refer to the [Stride docs](https://docs.stride.zone/docs).
