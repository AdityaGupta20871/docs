# Members and Roles

You can view the members of your organization under the Members tab. Spheron allows you to assign roles to these members. Roles are a set of permissions that defines the actions a user can perform in an organization. \
You can choose from the following three roles:
- **Owner**: full access
- **Admin**: can manage billing and domains along with all the member access
- **Member**: only has view access and can deploy projects
