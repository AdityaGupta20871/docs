# Members and Roles

You can view the members of your organization under the Members tab. Spheron allows you to assign roles to these members. Roles are a set of permissions that defines the actions a user can perform in an organization. \
You can choose from the following three roles:
- **Owner**: Full access
- **Admin**: Can manage billing and domains along with all the member access
- **Member**: Only has view access and can deploy projects

  **NOTE:** Only Owners and Admins can assign roles and invite members to join the organization.
</Callout>

## Invite Members
To invite members to your organization:
1. Click on Add Members in the Pending Invites section under the Members tab.
2. Enter the email address of members separated by commas (without spaces) and Click Send. 

These members will receive an invitation email from Spheron.
All members are assigned a member role when they first join the organization. You can then assign them different roles.
