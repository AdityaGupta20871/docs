# Domains

By default, Spheron provides a subdomain when a project is deployed.
Eg: subdomain.spheron.app
You can point your domain either to an environment or a particular deployment from an environment.

## Attach a Domain

Follow these steps to configure your domain:

1. Select your project.
2. Go to the 'Configure your Domains' section under the Domains tab.
3. Enter your Domain name.
4. Select Environments if you want to point your domain to environments.
5. Or, Select a Deployment if you want to point your domain to a particular deployment.
6. Click Add.
7. Add the records shown in the domain items in your DNS provider and Click Verify. That will verify the configuration in your DNS provider.
8. Wait for the domain records to propagate, then Click Verify DNS configuration.
