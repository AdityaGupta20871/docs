# Browser Upload SDK

The Browser Upload SDK is equipped with multi-chain storage capabilities powered by Spheron.

<Callout type="warning">
  The package is only meant for Browser environments.
</Callout>

## Installation

**Using NPM**

```
npm i @spheron/browser-upload
```

**Using Yarn**

```
yarn add @spheron/browser-upload
```

## Usage

The Browser SDK allows you to upload files directly from your browser to `IPFS`, `Filecoin` or `Arweave`. \
To use the Browser SDK, you have to set up the following:

1. A web server that will be used by the frontend to get the `uploadToken` for uploading the data.
2. A web app that uses `@spheron/browser-upload` to upload files directly from browser.

> You can checkout the working example [here](https://github.com/spheronFdn/sdk/tree/main/examples/browser-upload).

### Server

You have to set up a web server with an endpoint that will be used by the frontend to fetch the token for upload.
In the example, we have created a `/initiate-upload` endpoint.
Make use of the `createSingleUploadToken` method from `@spheron/storage` package to generate the `uploadToken`.

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** The `uploadToken` can only be used for a single upload and has an
  expiration of 10 minutes.
</Callout>

```js
import { SpheronClient, ProtocolEnum } from "@spheron/storage";

...

app.get("/initiate-upload", async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const bucketName = "example-browser-upload"; // use your preferred name
    const protocol = ProtocolEnum.IPFS; // use your preferred protocol
    const token = process.env.SPHERON_TOKEN; // add your access token in .env or paste it here

    const client = new SpheronClient({ token });

    const { uploadToken } = await client.createSingleUploadToken({
      name: bucketName,
      protocol,
    });

    res.status(200).json({
      uploadToken,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    next(error);
  }
});
```

You need to [Create an Access Token](/rest-api/#creating-an-access-token) to create the client.

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** Please choose `web app` type in the dashboard while generating the
  Access Token.
</Callout>

Function `createSingleUploadToken` takes two parameters:

- **name** - (string) - Represents the name of the bucket on which you are uploading the data.
- **protocol** - (string) - The protocol on which the data will be uploaded. The supported protocols are [ `ARWEAVE`, `IPFS`, `FILECOIN`].

**Response**

```js
interface TokenRes {
  uploadToken: string;
}
```

### Client

You have to send a request to your server to create the `uploadToken` that will be used to upload files from the browser.
In the example, we are sending a request to the `/initiate-upload` endpoint.
Make use of the `upload` method from `@spheron/browser-upload` to upload your files.

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** The `uploadToken` can only be used for a single upload and has an
  expiration of 10 minutes.
</Callout>

```js
import { upload } from "@spheron/browser-upload";

...

const response = await fetch(`<BACKEND_URL>/initiate-upload`); // get the temporary access token from server
const resJson = await response.json();
const token =  resJson.uploadToken;

let currentlyUploaded = 0;

const { uploadId, bucketId, protocolLink, dynamicLinks } = await upload(files, {
  token,
  onChunkUploaded: (uploadedSize, totalSize) => {
    currentlyUploaded += uploadedSize;
    console.log(`Uploaded ${currentlyUploaded} of ${totalSize} Bytes.`);
  },
});

...
```

This flow allows you to control who can use your `uploadToken` to upload files. \
Function `upload` takes two parameters:

- **files** - ( File[] | FileList ) - An array of files to be uploaded.
- **configuration:** An object with the following parameters:
  1.  `configuration.token`
      - The upload token that was fetched from server.
  2.  `configuration.onChunkUploaded` **(Optional)**
      - callback function `(uploadedSize: number, totalSize: number) => void`. The function will be called multiple times, depending on the upload size. The function will be called each time a chunk is uploaded, with two parameters. the first one `uploadedSize` represents the size in Bytes for the uploaded chunk. The `totalSize` represents the total size of the upload in Bytes.

**Response**

```js
interface UploadRes {
  uploadId: string;
  bucketId: string;
  protocolLink: string; // eg: https://{cid}.ipfs.sphn.link/
  dynamicLinks: string[];
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** The `protocolLink` in UploadRes will contain the **IPFS CID** only if the selected protocol is either IPFS or Filecoin.
