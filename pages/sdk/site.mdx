# Site SDK

The Site SDK is a npm package that provides support for working with Spheron Site organizations.

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** The package is only meant for Node.js environments.
</Callout>

## Installation

**Using NPM**

```
npm i @spheron/site
```

**Using Yarn**

```
yarn add @spheron/site
```

## Usage

To use the Site SDK, you have to create an instance of `SpheronClient`.

```js
import { SpheronClient, ProtocolEnum } from "@spheron/site";

const client = new SpheronClient({ token });
```

The `SpheronClient` constructor takes an object that has one property `token`.
Follow the instructions in the [DOCS](https://docs.spheron.network/rest-api/#creating-an-access-token) to generate this token.

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** When you are creating the tokens, please choose **web app** type in
  the dashboard.
</Callout>

The `SpheronClient` has three properties:

- `deployments` provides methods for working with deployments.
- `projects` provides methods for working with projects.
- `organization` provides methods for working with organizations.

## Deployments
