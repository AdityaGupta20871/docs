# Storage SDK

The Spheron Storage SDK is equipped with multi-chain storage capabilities powered by Spheron.

<Callout type="warning">
  The package is only meant for Node.js environments and will not work in a
  browser or frontend apps.
</Callout>

## Installation

**Using NPM**

```
npm i @spheron/storage
```

**Using Yarn**

```
yarn add @spheron/storage
```

## Usage

To use the Spheron Storage SDK, you have to create an instance of `SpheronClient`.

```js
import { SpheronClient, ProtocolEnum } from "@spheron/storage";

const client = new SpheronClient({ token });
```

The `SpheronClient` constructor takes an object that has one property `token`.
Follow the instructions in the [DOCS](https://docs.spheron.network/rest-api/#creating-an-access-token) to generate this token.

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** When you are creating the tokens, please choose **web app** type in
  the dashboard.
</Callout>

## Available Methods

The `SpheronClient` instance provides several methods for working with buckets. Here's the list of all the supported methods.

### Upload

Used to upload a file/directory to the specified protocol.

```js
let currentlyUploaded = 0;

const { uploadId, bucketId, protocolLink, dynamicLinks } = await client.upload(
  filePath,
  {
    protocol: ProtocolEnum.IPFS,
    name,
    onUploadInitiated: (uploadId) => {
      console.log(`Upload with id ${uploadId} started...`);
    },
    onChunkUploaded: (uploadedSize, totalSize) => {
      currentlyUploaded += uploadedSize;
      console.log(`Uploaded ${currentlyUploaded} of ${totalSize} Bytes.`);
    },
  }
);
```

Function `upload` takes two parameters:

- **filePath** - (string) - The path to the file/directory that will be uploaded.
- **configuration:** An object with the following parameters:
  1.  `configuration.name`
      - Represents the name of the bucket on which you are uploading the data.
  2.  `configuration.protocol`
      - The protocol on which the data will be uploaded. The supported protocols are [ `ARWEAVE`, `IPFS`, `FILECOIN`].
  3.  `configuration.onUploadInitiated` **(Optional)**
      - Callback function `(uploadId: string) => void`. The function will be called once, when the upload is initiated, right before the data is uploaded. The function will be called with one parameter, `uploadId`, which represents the id of the started upload.
  4.  `configuration.onChunkUploaded` **(Optional)**
      - Callback function `(uploadedSize: number, totalSize: number) => void`. The function will be called multiple times, depending on the upload size. The function will be called each time a chunk is uploaded, with two parameters. the first one `uploadedSize` represents the size in Bytes for the uploaded chunk. The `totalSize` represents the total size of the upload in Bytes.

**Response**

```js
interface UploadRes {
  uploadId: string;
  bucketId: string;
  protocolLink: string;
  dynamicLinks: Domain[];
  cid: string;
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** The CID property will only have value for IPFS and Filecoin uploads.
</Callout>

  DOMAIN = "domain",
  SUBDOMAIN = "subdomain",
  HANDSHAKE_DOMAIN = "handshake-domain",
  HANDSHAKE_SUBDOMAIN = "handshake-subdomain",
  ENS_DOMAIN = "ens-domain",

### Add Bucket Domain

Used to add a new domain to the specified bucket. The `link` property needs to have the `protocolLink` value of an existing bucket id. After adding a new domain, you will need to setup the record on your DNS provider:

- **domain**: you should create a **A** type record with value `13.248.203.0`, and the same name as the domain you have added.
- **subdomain** : you should create a **CNAME** type record with value `cname.spheron.io`, and the same name as the domain you have added.
- **handshake-domain**: you should create a **A** type record with value `ipfs.namebase.io`, and `@` for name. Also you should create a **TXT** type record with `link` for a value, and `_contenthash` for name.
- **handshake-subdomain**: you should create a **A** type record with value `ipfs.namebase.io`, and the same name as the domain you have added. Also you should create a **TXT** type record with `link` for a value, and `_contenthash.<name_of_the_domain>` for name.
- **ens-domain**: you should create a **CONTENT** type record with `link` for a value, and the same name as the domain you have added.

```js
const bucketDomain: Domain = await client.addBucketDomain(bucketId, {
  link,
  type,
  name,
});
```

Function `addBucketDomain` takes two parameters:

- **bucketId** - (string) - The id of the bucket.
- **bucketDetails** - An object with the link, type and name of the bucket to be added.

After you have setup the record on your DNS provider, then you should call the `verifyBucketDomain` method to verify your domain on Spheron. After the domain is verified, the data behind the link will be cached on the Spheron CDN.

**Response**

```js
enum DomainTypeEnum {
  DOMAIN = "domain",
  SUBDOMAIN = "subdomain",
  HANDSHAKE_DOMAIN = "handshake-domain",
  HANDSHAKE_SUBDOMAIN = "handshake-subdomain",
  ENS_DOMAIN = "ens-domain",

```js
import { ipfs } from "@spheron/storage";

const cid = <CID_VALUE>;

const v1 = ipfs.utils.toV1(cid);
console.log("CID V1", v1);

const v0 = ipfs.utils.toV0(cid);
console.log("CID V0", v0);
```
