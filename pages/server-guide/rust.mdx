# How to deploy a Rust App?

Rust is a modern systems programming language that focuses on memory safety, concurrency, and high performance. It empowers developers to create secure and scalable applications, making it an ideal choice for systems-level programming tasks.

In this guide, youâ€™ll configure a Rust app and deploy it to Spheron Compute using Docker.

### Prerequisites

To successfully follow this guide, you will need the following:

- A [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) account.
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed on your local machine.
- A text editor. You can use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or your favorite text editor.

## Step 1: Create a Rust App

1. Create a new Rust project by running the following command:
   ```sh
   cargo new rustapp
   ```
2. Change into the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd rustapp
   ```
3. Open the **Cargo.toml** file and add the following dependencies under the **[dependencies]** section:

   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   rocket = "0.5.0"
   ```

4. Open the **myproject/urls.py** file and replace its contents with the following code:

   ```rust
   #[macro_use]
   extern crate rocket;

   #[get("/hello")]
   fn hello() -> &'static str {
       "Hello, World!"
   }

   #[launch]
   fn rocket() -> _ {
        rocket::build().mount("/", routes![hello])
   }
   ```

5. Start the app by running the following command:

   ```sh
   cargo run
   ```

6. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:8000/hello. You should see the message "Hello, World!" displayed.
