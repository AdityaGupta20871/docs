# GIT Automations

Spheron has made it easier for teams to collaborate effectively without needing to visit the Spheron dashboard by implementing continuous deployments and workflow enhancements.

### PR Comments
When a user creates a pull request and initiates the last commit of the PR, Spheron posts comments containing the deployment Preview link and Deployment Logs link once the deployment is successful.
Additionally, the platform comments on the commit after a successful deployment from the dashboard.

### PR Checks
Spheron also posts deployment checks when a commit triggers deployment, which can be viewed in the pull request and redirected to the deployment log page.

### Github Environments
Spheron creates deployment environments in GitHub by default, including Production and Development, and posts deployment links to these environments for the team to view deployment history.

### Gitlab Builds
Similar to GitHub Environments, Spheron creates 2 build pipelines in Gitlab based on the two deployment environments and adds deployment links for the team to view the deployment history. With the addition of a new workflow for the Git Provider, continuous deployment is enabled by default.

### Git Fork Protection
If a pull request from a forked repository includes changes to a file, Spheron moves the deployment to the "Awaiting Authorization" state. It then requires authorization from the owner or an admin to deploy the pull request, protecting sensitive project information.
