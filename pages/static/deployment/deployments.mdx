# Manage Deployments

## GIT Automation
Spheron allows you to control continuous deployment for your projects. 
It creates a production environment with the central/master branch of your git repository and a development environment containing all the other branches. 
Whenever you create a new PR or add new commits to an existing PR, Spheron automatically deploys it if all the checks pass. 
The Spheron bot provides all comments associated with the checks and deployment in your git repository.


## Authorize deployment

If your website is hosted on Spheron without you being a part of the organization, then all your commits will go to the ‘authorize’ state. The owner or the admin has to authorize these commits before the changes appear on the website.
