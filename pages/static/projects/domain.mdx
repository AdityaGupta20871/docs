# Domains

By default, Spheron provides a subdomain when a project is deployed.
Eg: subdomain.spheron.app
You can point your domain either to an environment or a particular deployment from an environment.

## Attach a Domain

Follow these steps to configure your domain:

1. Select your project.
2. Go to the 'Configure your Domains' section under the Domains tab.
3. Enter your Domain name.
4. Select Environments if you want to point your domain to environments.
5. Or, Select a Deployment if you want to point your domain to a particular deployment.
6. Click Add.
7. Add the records shown in the platform to your DNS provider and wait for the domain records to propagate.
8. Click Verify after a few minutes. Your domain will connect to the deployment.

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** \
  1\. You cannot select both environments and deployments simultaneously. \
  2\. You can visit https://dnschecker.org/ to verify if your DNS is propagated. \
  3\. You cannot add the same domain in different projects in the same organization or separate organizations. To change your domain, you must delete it from the previous project and add it to the new project.
