# ENS Domains

[ENS (Ethereum Name Service)](https://ens.domains/) is a Blockchain domain naming protocol built especially for the Ethereum Blockchain. It allows you to create human-friendly and readable usernames for your dapps.

## Attach an ENS Domain

Follow these steps to configure your ENS domain:

1. Select your project.
2. Select ENS Domains from the sidebar and Go to the 'Configure your ENS Domains/Subdomains' section under the Domains tab.
3. Enter your ENS Domain name.
4. Select a deployment that you want your domain to point to and Click Add. You will see the selected configuration on the screen.
5. With Spheron, you can update your ENS content hash directly from the app. Click Update and confirm the transaction on Metamask to update the content hash. You can verify it in your ENS Domain Manager.
6. To manually update the content hash of your ENS domain, Go to your [ENS dashboard](https://app.ens.domains/) and Update your content hash with the CONTENT provided by Spheron.
7. Click Verify to verify the changes, and we will verify the records for you.

  **NOTE:** \
  Updating your domain name or content will always ask you to Update
  the record, as it changes the content hash.

## Access your ENS domains with Supported Resolvers.

If you are using an ENS-compatible browser, like Brave, or if you have the MetaMask extension installed, you can type: 'address.eth/' (remember the '/') in the search bar to resolve your address.

### Using eth.link​

This service, made available by ENS and Cloudflare, makes all the '.eth' domains accessible via traditional DNS addresses. Anyone can visit your site using '.link'! If you do not have them, you can add the '.link' suffix to visit your ENS domain on any browser.

### Using eth.limo​

Cloudflare's 'eth.link' is centralized and can experience downtimes. An alternative to 'eth.link' is 'eth.limo'. In that case, you can add the '.limo' suffix to visit your ENS domain.

<Callout type="warning">
  All these are third-party resolving options you can use to visit your '.eth'
  ENS domains. Contact the concerned providers if you face any issues after
  configuring your ENS record properly.
