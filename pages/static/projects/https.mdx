# HTTPS

Spheron Network offers **free HTTPS on all sites,** providing automatic certificate creation and renewal, except on ENS and HNS resolvers.
Our certificates use the **modern TLS protocol,** which has replaced the now-deprecated SSL standard, ensuring a higher level of security for the websites.

HTTPS brings in a lot of advantages:

- **Content integrity:** Without HTTPS, free Wi-Fi services can inject ads into your pages.
- **Security:** If your site has a login or accepts form submissions, HTTPS is essential for your usersâ€™ security and privacy.
- **Trust:** HTTPS protects your personal information, such as your passwords and credit card numbers, from being stolen by hackers.
- **SEO:** Google search results prioritize sites with HTTPS enabled.
- **Referral analytics:** HTTPS-enabled sites will not send referral data to sites without HTTPS.
- **Performance:** HTTPS can actually improve the performance of your website by reducing the number of round trips that need to be made between the browser and the server.
