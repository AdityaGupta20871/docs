# HTTPS
Spheron Protocol offers free HTTPS on all sites, including automatic certificate creation and renewal, except on ENS and HNS resolvers. 
Our certificates use the modern TLS protocol, which has replaced the now-deprecated SSL standard.

HTTPS brings in a lot of advantages:
- **Content integrity:** Without HTTPS, free Wi-Fi services can inject ads into your pages.
- **Security:** If your site has a login or accepts form submissions, HTTPS is essential for your usersâ€™ security and privacy.
- **SEO:** Google search results prioritize sites with HTTPS enabled.
- **Referral analytics:** HTTPS-enabled sites will not send referral data to sites without HTTPS.
